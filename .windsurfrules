# Comprehensive Rules

## 1. Communication Principles
- **Use Vietnamese in all situations:**
  - All answers, explanations, analyses must be written in Vietnamese
  - Comments in code should also use Vietnamese for better understanding
  - Use clear wording, avoid mechanical translation from English to Vietnamese
  - For technical terms without Vietnamese equivalents, the original term can be kept with a brief explanation if needed

## 2. Analysis Process
- **Comprehensive approach:**
  - Always thoroughly analyze all aspects of the problem before providing solutions
  - Clearly identify functional and non-functional requirements
  - Evaluate alternative solutions before deciding
  - Consider the impact of solutions on performance, security, and user experience
- **Research methodology:**
  - Study the existing codebase thoroughly to understand structure and logic
  - Analyze in detail the properties, data relationships, and related business logic
  - Look for design patterns being applied in the project
  - Review libraries and frameworks being used to ensure consistency
